# Conway's Game of Life

I use [Conway's Game of Life](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway's_Game_of_Life) to practice programming and try out languages. 

The inspiration came from participating in one of the [Code Retreats](http://coderetreat.com), where we implemented Game of Life over and over again, working on TDD practices and writing clean code. 

It's a form of [code kata](http://codekata.pragprog.com) â€“ the point is to practice TDD and writing clean code. 

It's also an opportunity to get aquainted with new languages and test frameworks.

## Implementations so far
* [Ruby](http://www.ruby-lang.org) with [RSpec](https://www.relishapp.com/rspec) and [Cucumber](http://cukes.info) - starting off in a familiar language
* [Coffeescript](http://coffeescript.org) with [Jasmine](http://pivotal.github.com/jasmine) and [underscore.js](http://documentcloud.github.com/underscore)
